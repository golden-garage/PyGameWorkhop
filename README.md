# PyGameWorkhop

This repo contains lessons used in a PyGame after school program.

## Activities

*Lessons* are group into *Activities*.

Each *Activity* has a planned duration of 90 mins.

Most *Activities* are either complete games or complete game levels.

The *Activities* are ordered.

Each new *Activity* builds on the knowledge and reuses the code from older *Activities*.

### Wormy

In this *Activity*,  students build the classic arcade game, Snake (also known as Nibbles).

> The code used in this lesson was inspired by [Wormy (a Nibbles clone)](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame) from
> [Al Sweigart](http://inventwithpython.com):

When this *Lesson* is complete, the student will have developed a complete game.

#### Lesson 1 - hello wormy

* game initialization

    - specific to Raspberry Pi's in text mode

    - optimized for a 1280x1024 display (classroom default)

* basic game loop

```python
while true:
    display();
```
          
* display text
* 
Code involved to display a screen

````import pygame   // since we are using the library of pygame we need to import it.
````pygame.init     // This is important for initialising all the pygame modules

// Now let us create a surface called gameDisplay

```gameDisplay = pygame.display.set_mode(1280,1024) // we set the resolution of the screen to be 1280 x 1024

```pygame.display.update() // This function is used to update the entire screen. We we want to make any animations we need the frame to be updated for every change. Hence this function is necessary.

```pygame.quit()

// When we run this program we see that a display just flashes once.



#### Lesson 2 - goodbye wormy

* basic event handling

```python
while GAME_IS_RUNNING:
    handle_events();
    display_game();
```

* key press to end game

#### Lesson 3 - spinning hello

* updating game objects

```python
while GAME_IS_RUNNING:
    handle_events();
    update_game_objects();
    display_game();
```

* text rotates with each game loop

* framerate (speed up, slowdown)

#### Lesson 4 - game scens

* each game scene has its own game loop

* switch scenes

* game board with grid and scoreboard

#### Lesson 5 - random apples

* basic drawing

* random drawing

* list of objects to draw each frame

* use + - keys to add remove random apples

#### Lesson 6 - wormy lives (and dies)

* use arrow keys to move, one square at a time

* use arrow keys to choose direction

* game ends, end game scene

#### Lesson 7 - wormy eats apples

* scoreboard is updated

* new apples replace eaten apples

* different kinds of apples

#### Lesson 7 - wormy grows

* wormy has an array of body parts

* each part follows the previous

* wormy shouldn't eat himself

#### Lesson 8 - endgame

* lives

* high scorelist

#### Lesson 9 - credits

* scrolling credit scene

* game optimization and feature requests
